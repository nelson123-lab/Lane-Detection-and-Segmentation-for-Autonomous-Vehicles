# Lane-Detection-and-Segmentation-for-Autonomous-Vehicles

- Developed a lane detection and segmentation system for autonomous vehicles using the U-Net architecture, which is a popular CNN architecture for image segmentation tasks.
- Trained the U-Net model to accurately detect and segment lane markings in the environment, using a combination of thresholding, region growing, and machine learning-based methods.
- Achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting and segmenting lane markings in a variety of lighting and weather conditions, which can improve the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving.
- Reduced the workload of autonomous vehicle operators by automating the lane detection and segmentation process, allowing them to focus on other tasks.
