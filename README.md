# Lane-Detection-and-Segmentation-for-Autonomous-Vehicles

- Developed a lane detection and segmentation system for autonomous vehicles using the U-Net architecture, which is a popular CNN architecture for image segmentation tasks.
- Trained the U-Net model to accurately detect and segment lane markings in the environment, using a combination of thresholding, region growing, and machine learning-based methods.
- Achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting and segmenting lane markings in a variety of lighting and weather conditions, which can improve the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving.
- Reduced the workload of autonomous vehicle operators by automating the lane detection and segmentation process, allowing them to focus on other tasks.

There are several CNN architectures that can be used for lane detection and segmentation in autonomous vehicles. Some of the commonly used CNN architectures are:
1. U-Net: U-Net is a popular CNN architecture for image segmentation tasks. It has an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that allow for precise segmentation of objects in images.
2. SegNet: SegNet is another CNN architecture that is commonly used for image segmentation tasks. It has an encoder-decoder structure with pooling indices that allow for efficient segmentation of objects in images.
3. DeepLab: DeepLab is a CNN architecture that is designed for semantic segmentation tasks. It uses atrous convolution to capture multi-scale contextual information and has a fully connected conditional random field layer for post-processing.
4. Mask R-CNN: Mask R-CNN is a CNN architecture that is designed for object detection and segmentation tasks. It uses a region proposal network to generate object proposals and a mask head to generate pixel-level segmentation masks.
The choice of CNN architecture depends on the specific requirements of the project, such as the size of the dataset, the complexity of the environment, and the desired level of accuracy.
